# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Market Forecasting using Time Series Models & LSTM  

A time series forecasting project comparing **classical models (ARIMA, SARIMAX, Prophet)** with a **Stacked LSTM** neural network to predict stock closing prices and forecast short-term market behavior.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  

This project explores different approaches to **time series forecasting** on stock market data. Using 5 years of historical stock prices (2015â€“2020), the goal was to predict short-term future prices and compare how **statistical models** vs. **deep learning models** perform on financial data.  

ðŸ”‘ **Key finding** â†’ Traditional models capture trends but struggle with volatility, while LSTMs provide a strong historical fit but face challenges in forecasting due to noisy, non-stationary markets influenced by external factors (news, sentiment, earnings, etc.).

## ðŸ“Š Workflow  

1. **Data Source**: Historical stock data from Yahoo Finance (`AAPL.csv`)  
2. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Index reset and closing price extraction  
   - Stationarity checks (ADF test)  
   - Train-test split and scaling (for LSTM)  
3. **Modeling**:  
   - **ARIMA / SARIMAX** â†’ for statistical baselines  
   - **Facebook Prophet** â†’ for trend + seasonality detection  
   - **Stacked LSTM** â†’ deep learning sequence model with sliding windows (150-day input â†’ 1-day prediction)  
4. **Evaluation & Plotting**:  
   - Visualized predicted vs. actual stock prices  
   - Extended predictions for **next 50 days** using recursive forecasting  
   - Compared models on trend-capturing ability vs. volatility handling  
5. **Results**:  
   - **ARIMA/SARIMAX**: captured basic trends, limited forecasting accuracy  
   - **Prophet**: good trend detection, missed volatility  
   - **LSTM**: strong historical fit, weaker generalization for future forecasting
